## Description 

This Planetary Age Calculator will be an application designed to collect a user's age and life expectancy in their native Earth years and then return what their age is in terms of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter years. It can also determine how many years they have left to live in each planet's years or how long they have lived past their life expectancy if they have already done so.
